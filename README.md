# Important routing notes - 
## How does routing work in the latest v of Next.js?

In order to create a route, you need to create a folder w the route name & include a "page.js" file inside that folder. "page.js" file will determine the contents of the page. 

### Ex: 'app/about/page.tsx' & 'app/about/team/leadership/page.tsx'
This corresponds to the URL '/about'. 
This corresponds to the URL '/about/team/leadership'.
